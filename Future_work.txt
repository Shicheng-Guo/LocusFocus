Known bugs:
- Fix issue where gene names overlap in larger-defined regions
- Test different LD matrix file inputs
- chrX plots do not show correctly

to do:
- allow downloading of the integrated session data
- allow deleting of the session data
- allow option to match variant names by just chrom:pos information (currently should only be either all rsid's or all variant_id format)
- Allow user input for their own eQTL p-values as a tsv file (eg. PsychENCODE eQTLs)​
- Generate updated 1KG Phase 3 binary PLINK files for LD calculations (currently only have chr1 2012 1KG file)
- Store json session data into Mongo Atlas instead for better security
- Allow download of integrated session data​
- Add a button for user to be able to delete their session data
- Add a cron job to delete sessions at regular intervals
- Allow user to set the window sizes for eQTL lines
- Make a table of GWAS and eQTL merged results
- Another site for hg38
- Allow assessment of beta correlations
- Make P-P plot
- Allow uploading several secondary datasets for pairwise SS calculations with primary dataset
