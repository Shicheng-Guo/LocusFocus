Known bugs:
- chrX plots do not show correctly

to do:
- need to expand gwas dataset to include snps missing from it, but available in secondary datasets
- allow deleting of the session data
- allow option to match variant names by just chrom:pos information (currently should only be either all rsid's or all variant_id format)
- Generate updated 1KG Phase 3 binary PLINK files for LD calculations (currently only have chr1 2012 1KG file)
- Store json session data into Mongo Atlas instead for better security
- Add a cron job to delete sessions at regular intervals or when disk is almost full
- Allow user to set the window sizes for eQTL lines; make calculation clearer
- Make a table of GWAS and eQTL merged results
- Another site for hg38
- Allow assessment of beta correlations
- Make P-P plot
