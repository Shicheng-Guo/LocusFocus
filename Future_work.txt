to do:
- gene name mapping file consistency required; ensure ENSG names have versions added or robustify searching
- create the session data in Mongo
- allow downloading of the integrated session data
- allow deleting of the session data
- allow option to match variant names by just chrom:pos information (currently should only be either all rsid's or all variant_id format)

- Write documentation
- Option of LD matrix should be either from user of 1KG, not both
- Test different LD matrix file inputs
- Allow user input for their own eQTL p-values as a tsv file (eg. PsychENCODE eQTLs)​
- Generate updated 1KG Phase 3 binary PLINK files for LD calculations (currently only have chr1 2012 1KG file)
- Ensure coordinate range entered is within reasonable limits
- Inform why not all tissues selected appear in the end
- Draw the genes with names beside them
- Store json session data into Mongo Atlas instead for better security
- Allow download of integrated session data​
- Add a button for user to be able to delete their session data
- Add a cron job to delete sessions at regular intervals
- Allow user to set the window sizes for line drawing
- Allow downloading a json file
- Allow loading a session (json) file instead of tsv to get the interactive plot instantly
- Make a table of GWAS and eQTL merged results
- Make a MySQL database to hold the GTEx eQTL data (will require at >200GB of space)
- Change the code to query local GTEx DB
- Another site for hg38
- Allow assessment of beta correlations
